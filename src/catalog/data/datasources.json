This dataset is the same as the Sentinel-2 dataset, except the JP2K files were converted into Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs). Additionally, SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog metadata has were in a JSON file alongside the data, and a STAC API called Earth-search is freely available to search the archive.

Images The images are of U2OS cells treated with each of 1600 known bioactive compounds and labeled with six labels that characterize seven organelles (the .cell-painting. assay).
