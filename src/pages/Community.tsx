					<h3>Community calls</h3>
					<p>
						Scivision runs an online call (over Zoom) from time to time,
						generally themed around computer vision or image analysis in a
						particular domain. There will also be a chance for an introduction
						to the Scivision project and hear any recent news.
					</p>
					<p>Future events will be advertised on Slack and the mailing list.</p>
					<h3>Slack Workspace</h3>
					<p>The Scivision Slack workspace is open to anyone interested in:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Discussing computer vision in the sciences and humanities</li>
						<li>
							Getting help with computer vision methods, and helping others
						</li>
						<li>Getting support using the Scivision catalogue and software</li>
						<li>Sharing and finding out about interesting events</li>
