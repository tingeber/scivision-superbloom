## Email Newsletter

Scivision has a low-volume email newsletter for announcements about the project and forthcoming events (one email per month or so). Read previous newsletters or subscribe to the list on Substack: https://scivision.substack.com.

It is possible to unsubscribe at any time by following the link at the bottom of any email from the list.

## Community calls

Scivision runs an online call (over Zoom) from time to time, generally themed around computer vision or image analysis in a particular domain. There will also be a chance for an introduction to the Scivision project and hear any recent news.

Future events will be advertised on Slack and the mailing list.

## Slack Workspace

The Scivision Slack workspace is open to anyone interested in:

-   Discussing computer vision in the sciences and humanities
-   Getting help with computer vision methods, and helping others
-   Getting support using the Scivision catalogue and software
-   Sharing and finding out about interesting events

We aim for this to be a welcome and supportive place to discuss computer vision, share ideas and ask questions. Using (or even intending to use) the Scivision software is not a prerequisite for joining!

To join the Slack Workspace, [submit your email address](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfDPbsb_CWApnodHlNyOQMQdKhKA9meJi_SAuh8K8dVpbIiDA/viewform?usp=sf_link) (via a Google Form) and one of the team will invite you.
